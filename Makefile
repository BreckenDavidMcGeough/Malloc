# This rule generates an ELF shared object that can be used to test your
# malloc against any UNIX application!  Applications that use threading
# are likely to fail in unexpected ways, but single-threaded
# applications will probably work fine.
#
# You can use this library by running the application as follows:
#
# LD_PRELOAD=./libcsemalloc.so command
#
# For example, to use your malloc implementation in the standard UNIX ls
# command, you would run:
#
# LD_PRELOAD=./libcsemalloc.so ls
#
# Note that the given code will not successfully run ls, as it does not
# implement realloc.  It will, however, run `ls --help` and several
# other commands (that do not use realloc).
